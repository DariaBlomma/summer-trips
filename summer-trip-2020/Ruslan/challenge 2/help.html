<p>First, read and translate the questions. Write down the new words not to forget them. </p>
<p>Then, look through the text and find the places where the answers are. Mark these places - you will need to understand them very well.</p>
<p>After that, start translating. Pay special attention to the marked places. Maybe, you will have to translate more words there.</p>
<p>Do not translate every unknown word. If you can understand, even approximately, the meaning of a paragraph, go further. </p>
<p>If you feel, that some details are important, but you don't understand them, translate some words. </p>
<p>The less you translate - the better. You won't enjoy reading if you translate every single word</p>
